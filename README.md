## Heyo
### The name's Chippy, good to see you here!

I usually mess around with Python, creating Discord bots and little scripts in the process. APIs and Image processing are other things I'm currently looking into. I've recently started looking into the Rust programming language and while the journey so far has been a little rough, I'm determined to see this through to the end.  

Fun fact: I actually started learning Python to make a Discord bot. The motivation was mainly "let's give this a try" :D

At the moment, I'm programming mainly for personal projects, but I'm interested to see what working in a team is like.   
You can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/811315518555422802), this is where I'm most active at the moment.
