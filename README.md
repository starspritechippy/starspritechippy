## Heyo
### The name's Chippy, good to see you here!

I usually mess around with Python, creating Discord bots and little scripts in the process. APIs and Image processing are other things I'm currently looking into.  

Fun fact: I actually started learning Python to make a Discord bot. The motivation was mainly "let's give this a try" :D

At the moment, I'm programming mainly for personal projects and not looking for group projects, though if you need some help with your Discord bot, I can take a look!  
You can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/262133866062413825), this is where I'm most active at the moment.
