## Heyo
### The name's Chippy, good to see you here!

It's been a rough journey so far, coding on-and-off for and long periods of drought in between, but I'm working to change that soon! I've mainly been using Python but also dabbling in JS/TS and Rust from time to time. The preference is with Python of course since I know that better.

Fun fact: I actually started my programming journey with Python, trying to make a Discord bot. The motivation was mainly "let's give this a try" :D

At the moment, I'm programming mainly for personal projects, but I'm interested to see what working in a team is like.

Hoping to fill this page up more as I get more into coding again.
